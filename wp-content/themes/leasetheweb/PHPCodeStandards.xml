<ruleset name="BSD Wordpress Theme">
  <description>
    Adaptation of the PSR-2 coding standard for Wordpress themes. Excludes the
    rules, inherited from PSR-1, that a file should not declare new symbols and
    cause side effects and that classes must be namespaced. This allows Timber
    classes to be extended in the theme's functions.php.
